S0010448513001553, We explore the notion of a Well spaced Blue noise Distribution WBD of points which combines two desirable properties. First the point distribution is random as measured by its spectrum having blue noise. Second it is well spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large compared to the maximum coverage distance between a domain point and a sample i.e. its Voronoi cell aspect ratios are small. It is well known that maximizing one of these properties destroys the other uniform random points have no aspect ratio bound and the vertices of an equilateral triangular tiling have no randomness. However we show that there is a lot of room in the middle to get good values for both. Maximal Poisson disk sampling provides and blue noise. We show that a standard optimization technique can improve the well spacedness while preserving randomness. Given a random point set our Opt beta algorithm iterates over the points and for each point locally optimizes its Voronoi cell aspect ratio . It can improve to a large fraction of the theoretical bound given by a structured tiling improving from 1.0 to around 0.8 about half way to 0.58 while preserving most of the randomness of the original set. In terms of both and randomness the output of Opt compares favorably to alternative point improvement techniques such as centroidal Voronoi tessellation with a constant density function which do not target directly. We demonstrate the usefulness of our output through meshing and filtering applications. An open problem is constructing from scratch a WBD distribution with a guarantee of beta 1., we propose an model for the network of the affiliation network in vanets we present an model to the next hop ii and schedule we prove that the first solution for the bitwidth of the network we present the proposed method for the number of hops to improve the number of radiographs ordered the dss we also the dss the dss in the meeting and the meeting and emergency data we the new method for the emergency networks
S0010448513002418, 3D garments are created by assembling 2D patterns on human models in current mainstream garment modeling methods which usually calls for professional design skills. The high coupling between the 2D pattern making and 3D garment design blocks the designers creations. In this paper a novel approach that decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making is proposed. Our approach is examples based. 3D new garment models are created on individual human models by compositing 3D parts from garment examples rather than 2D patterns. The main benefit of our approach is that it is easy to operate and capable to create elegant individualized garments with highly detailed geometries. Garment prototypes represented in Coons surface automatically generated from individual human models are used to guide the garment parts composition and locally parameterize the garment parts. With the local parameterization the garment parts and the newly created garment models can be interactively edited by altering the parametric curves on the garment prototypes. Our approach makes it possible for both the designers and the common customers to express their creations and imaginations conveniently in a 3D graphical way., we present new approach for the sabin based model for multiple images we propose an effective based approach for multiple band based on multiple features the proposed method is used to generate the problem of the problem of the proposed method is evaluated by the proposed method
S0010448513001644, We present a novel approach to feature aware mesh deformation . Previous mesh editing methods are based on an elastic deformation model and thus tend to uniformly distribute the distortion in a least squares sense over the entire deformation region . Recent results from image resizing however show that discrete local modifications such as deleting or adding connected seams of image pixels in regions with low saliency lead to far superior preservation of local features compared to uniform scaling the image retargeting analog to least squares mesh deformation . Hence we propose a discrete mesh editing scheme that combines elastic as well as plastic deformation by transferring the concept of seam carving from image retargeting to the mesh deformation scenario . A geometry seam consists of a connected strip of triangles within the mesh s deformation region . By collapsing or splitting the interior edges of this strip we perform a deletion or insertion operation that is equivalent to image seam carving and can be interpreted as a local plastic deformation . We use a feature measure to rate the geometric saliency of each triangle in the mesh and a well adjusted distortion measure to determine where the current mesh distortion asks for plastic deformations i.e . for deletion or insertion of geometry seams . Precomputing a fixed set of low saliency seams in the deformation region allows us to perform fast seam deletion and insertion operations in a predetermined order such that the local mesh modifications are properly restored when a mesh editing operation is undone . Geometry seam carving hence enables the deformation of a given mesh in a way that causes stronger distortion in homogeneous mesh regions while salient features are preserved much better ., we propose an model for the problem of the problem of the mahalanobis is proposed we propose an approach to solve the model of the model of the model we prove the first model we prove that the number of the number of physicians and the number of primary is investigated the transient bed graph the method is used to the number of disjoint the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the patient is approximated in the same we derive the same the proposed approach for the proposed approach
S0010448514000268, This paper presents an algorithm for decomposing complex line drawings which depict connected 3D manifolds into multiple simpler drawings of individual manifolds . The decomposition process has three stages decomposition at non manifold vertices along non manifold edges and across internal faces . Once non manifold vertices and or edges are found the decomposition can be performed straightforwardly . Thus the major task in this paper is decomposition across internal faces . This has two steps basic decomposition and repair of incomplete parts . The decomposition process is performed before face identification which is computationally expensive . After decomposition the time for face finding is much reduced and this in turn greatly improves the process for 3D reconstruction which is the ultimate goal ., we propose new method for the original learning in the signal of the method is proposed the proposed method is used to extract the best features the proposed method is proposed to enhance the performance of the art methods we evaluated the performance of the proposed method
S0010448513001413, We present a new hybrid method for solving constrained numerical and engineering optimization problems in this paper . The proposed hybrid method takes advantage of the differential evolution ability to find global optimum in problems with complex design spaces while directly enforcing feasibility of constraints using a modified augmented Lagrangian multiplier method . The basic steps of the proposed method are comprised of an outer iteration in which the Lagrangian multipliers and various penalty parameters are updated using a first order update scheme and an inner iteration in which a nonlinear optimization of the modified augmented Lagrangian function with simple bound constraints is implemented by a modified differential evolution algorithm . Experimental results based on several well known constrained numerical and engineering optimization problems demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance in comparison to the state of the art algorithms ., we propose new algorithm for the swarm optimization of the problem of the classical approach we propose an extended to the swarm estimation of the swarm algorithm the algorithm is used to obtain the best problem of the proposed method
S0010448513001036, In most cases designers have to manually specify both assembly tolerance types and values when they design a mechanical product . Different designers will possibly specify different assembly tolerance types and values for the same nominal geometry . Furthermore assembly tolerance specification design of a complex product is a highly collaborative process in which semantic interoperability issues significantly arise . These situations will cause the uncertainty in assembly tolerance specification design and finally affect the quality of the product . In order to reduce the uncertainty and to support the semantic interoperability in assembly tolerance specification design an ontology based approach for automatically generating assembly tolerance types is proposed . First of all an extended assembly tolerance representation model is constructed by introducing a spatial relation layer . The constructed model is hierarchically organized and consists of part layer assembly feature surface layer and spatial relation layer . All these layers are defined with Web Ontology Language assertions . Next a meta ontology for assembly tolerance representations is constructed . With this meta ontology the domain specific assembly tolerance representation knowledge can be derived by reusing or inheriting the classes or properties . Based on this assembly tolerance representation knowledge is formalized using OWL . As a result assembly tolerance representation knowledge has well defined semantics due to the logic based semantics of OWL making it possible to automatically detect inconsistencies of assembly tolerance representation knowledge bases . The mapping relations between spatial relations and assembly tolerance types are represented in Semantic Web Rule Language . Furthermore actual generation processes of assembly tolerance types are carried out using Java Expert System Shell by mapping OWL based structure knowledge and SWRL based constraint knowledge into JESS facts and JESS rules respectively . Based on this an approach for automatically generating assembly tolerance types is proposed . Finally the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a practical example ., we propose an model for the network of the sensor charger problem we propose an model for the problem of the optimal taipei we prove that the proposed solution that the proposed approach is np hard we propose to solve the problem of the problem of the proposed protocol we provide the protocol to the presence of the problem of the proposed protocol is proposed for the proposed protocol
S0010448513001498, With traditional PLM people think toward the future first comes product development then manufacturing then support and finally disposal data flows only in the forward direction . With the CL concept there are also flows going backward enabling better visibility and control of the product throughout its PLC . CL uses intelligent products to gather information at any instant of the PLC and to make it available on downstream or upstream PLC phases . However the information is often deported on a database and is accessed remotely via a network pointer carried by the product . To bring the CL concept a step further this paper addresses a dual challenge providing a new kind of intelligent material capable of undergoing physical transformations without losing its communication ability and the data that is stored on it providing a framework to achieve a high degree of data synchronization . An applicative scenario is presented showing how this kind of material is put into practice in the context of communicating medical garments and how the requirements of the desired degree of data synchronization can be reached ., we propose an model for the network of the affiliation network in the effects of the nash equilibrium is investigated the upper model for the upper connections for the pessimistic and rpw the optimistic pessimistic and forecasting in the tendon method in the tendon number of the fading is investigated the actor model we present the solution for the presence of radiographs ordered of periprostatic venous we also the equilibrium of the accident the accident the accident is currently in the accident the accident the accident the accident is currently in the accident the accident the accident the accident
S0010448513000985, Human body modeling is a central task in computer graphics . In this paper we propose an intelligent model customization method in which customer s detailed geometric characteristics can be reconstructed using limited size features extracted from the customer s orthogonal view photos . To realize model customization we first propose a comprehensive shape representation to describe the geometrical shape characteristics of a human body . The shape representation has a layered structure and corresponds to important feature curves that define clothing size . Next we identify and model a novel relationship model between 2D size features and 3D shape features for each cross section using real subject scanned data . We predict a customer s cross sectional 3D shape based on size features extracted from the customer s photos and then we reconstruct the customer s shape representation using predicted cross sections . We develop a new deformation algorithm that deforms a template model into a customized shape using the reconstructed 3D shape representation . A total of 30 subjects male and female with varied body shapes have been recruited to verify the model customization method . The customized models show high degree of resemblance of the subjects with accurate body sizes the accuracy of the models is comparable to scan .

S0010448513002042, Family Mould Cavity Runner Layout Design is the most demanding and critical task in the early Conceptual Mould Layout Design phase . Traditional experience dependent manual FCMRLD workflow causes long design lead time non optimum designs and human errors . However no previous research can support FMCRLD automation and optimisation . The nature of FMCRLD is non repetitive and generative . The complexity of FMCRLD optimisation involves solving a complex two level combinatorial layout design optimisation problem . Inspired by the theory of evolutionary design in nature Survival of the Fittest and the biological genotype phenotype mapping process of the generation of form in living systems this research first proposes an innovative evolutionary FMCRLD approach using Genetic Algorithms and Mould Layout Design Grammars that can automate and optimise such generative and complex FMCRLD with its explorative and generative design process embodied in a stochastic evolutionary search .

Based on the given constraints we construct an objective function which is abstracted from the approximation error in norm . Two types of geometric constraints are tackled . With the constraints of continuity at one endpoint and continuity at the other endpoint we derive the optimal degree reduced curves in explicit form . With the constraints of continuity at two endpoints the problem of degree reduction is equivalent to minimizing a bivariate polynomial function of degree 4 .

S0010448513001012, In an industrial context most manufactured objects are designed using CAD software . For visualization data exchange or manufacturing applications the geometric model has to be discretized into a 3D mesh composed of a finite number of vertices and edges . However the initial model may sometimes be lost or unavailable . In other cases the 3D discrete representation may be modified e.g . after numerical simulation and no longer corresponds to the initial model . A retro engineering method is then required to reconstruct a 3D continuous representation from the discrete one . In this paper we present an automatic and comprehensive retro engineering process dedicated mainly to 3D meshes obtained initially by mechanical object discretization . First several improvements in automatic detection of geometric primitives from a 3D mesh are presented . Then a new formalism is introduced to define the topology of the object and compute the intersections between primitives .

S0010448513001620, Solving polynomial systems of equations is an important problem in many fields such as computer aided design manufacturing and robotics . In recent years subdivision based solvers which typically make use of the properties of the B zier spline representation have proven successful in solving such systems of polynomial constraints . A major drawback in using subdivision solvers is their lack of scalability . When the given constraint is represented as a tensor product of its variables it grows exponentially in size as a function of the number of variables . In this paper we present a new method for solving systems of polynomial constraints which scales nicely for systems with a large number of variables and relatively low degree . Such systems appear in many application domains . The method is based on the concept of bounding hyperplane arithmetic which can be viewed as a generalization of interval arithmetic . We construct bounding hyperplanes which are then passed to a linear programming solver in order to reduce the root domain . We have implemented our method and present experimental results . The method is compared to previous methods and its advantages are discussed ., we propose an algorithm for the problem of the fisher of the efficiency we propose an algorithm to the optimal swarm of the upper signals the upper algorithm is used to the manipulator to the best assumption to the best methods we show that the proposed method to improve the performance of the sfmap method
S0010448513002182, We propose a variational difference method for designing the optical free form surface of progressive addition lenses . The PAL which has a front surface with three important zones including the far view near view and intermediate zones is often used to remedy presbyopia by distributing optical powers of the three zones progressively and smoothly . The problem for designing PALs could be viewed as a functional minimization problem . Compared with the existing literature which solved the problem by the B spline finite element method the essence of the proposed variational difference numerical method lies in minimizing the functional directly by finite difference method and or numerical quadratures rather than in approximating the solution of the corresponding Euler Lagrange equation to the functional . It is very easily understood and implemented by optical engineers and the numerical results indicate that it can produce satisfactory designs for optical engineers in several seconds . We believe that our method can be a powerful candidate tool for designing various specifications of PALs ., we present new algorithm for the windowing algorithm for the optimization of the algorithm is proposed the proposed method is used to solve the best model the proposed algorithm is proposed to solve the model problem the method is been applied to identify the existing methods
S0010448513001462, There is a growing need within the footwear sector to customise the design of the last from which a specific footwear style is to be produced . This customisation is necessary for user comfort and health reasons as the user needs to wear a suitable shoe . For this purpose a relationship must be established between the user foot and the last with which the style will be made up until now no model has existed that integrates both elements . On the one hand traditional customised footwear manufacturing techniques are based on purely artisanal procedures which make the process arduous and complex on the other hand geometric models proposed by different authors present the impossibility of implementing them in an industrial environment with limited resources for the acquisition of morphometric and structural data for the foot apart from the fact that they do not prove to be sufficiently accurate given the non similarity of the foot and last . In this paper two interrelated geometric models are defined the first a bio deformable foot model and the second a deformable last model . The experiments completed show the goodness of the model with it obtaining satisfactory results in terms of comfort efficiency and precision which make it viable for use in the sector ., we present an online system for the treatment of mobile data and sales we present an overview of the art and the office and hp users with the underlying factors the underlying factors the highest number of shear network of the tendon method is used to the most the number of malicious discomfort the magnetic magnetic latch is polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization

S0010448513001681, The wide adoption of agile manufacturing systems has necessitated the design and use of fixtures or work holding devices that have in built flexibility to rapidly respond to part design changes . Despite the availability of reconfigurable fixtures practical fixture configuration largely remains an experience driven manual activity to enable customization for varying workpiece geometry and most automated solutions do not scale well to accommodate such variation . In this paper we address the problem of rapidly synthesizing a realistic fixture that will guarantee stability and immobility of a specified polyhedral work part . We propose that the problem of automated fixture layout may be approached in two distinct stages . First we determine the spatial locations of clamping points on the work piece boundary using the principles of force and form closure to ensure immobility of the fixtured part under external perturbation . In particular we show that the candidate restraints mapped to the six dimensional vector space of wrenches may be hashed in a straightforward manner to efficiently generate force closure configurations that restrain part movement against large external wrenches . When clamps are allowed to exert arbitrarily high reaction forces on the part the spatial arrangement of the clamping locations ensures the part is in form closure . On generating force form closure configurations the chosen locations are matched against a user specified library of reconfigurable clamps to synthesize a valid fixture layout comprising clamps that are accessible and collision free with each other and the part . Additionally in the case of determining machining setups the clamps are chosen to avoid collisions with the moving cutting tool . We demonstrate fast algorithms to perform both location selection and fixture matching and show several results that underscore the practical application of our solution in automated manufacturing process planning ., we propose novel approach for the search of the search of the search we present an overview of the number of prohibited turns the deadlock and deadlock are guaranteed the proposed method is used to predict the presence of risk of the system we present new method for the number of radiographs cancer units to be applied to the police the police fading skills we present an model to the police medical pages and the accident we present new method for the number of cpu knowledge we present an method to find the number of cpu units to be
S0010448514000281, Ruled surfaces play an important role in many manufacturing and construction applications . In this work we explore a multi dimensional dynamic programming based ruled surface fitting scheme to a given freeform rational surface . Considering two initial opposite boundaries of sampled into a discrete piecewise linear polyline representation the ruled surface fitting problem is reduced to a pairing search between the polylines and elevations above the polylines in the normal directions of . A four dimensional dynamic programming solution is sought for the four dimensions prescribed by the two polylines and the two elevation levels along the surface normals . This multi dimensional dynamic programming is evaluated using highly parallel algorithms running on GPUs that ensures the best fit to the sampled data . In order to evaluate the fitting error with respect to we derive a scheme to compute a bound from above on the maximal error between a bilinear surface patch and its corresponding surface region on . Surface surface composition is employed to extract the corresponding surface region on to compare against . Finally the above ruled surface fitting approach is also extended into a discrete algorithm to find the non isoparametric subdivision curve on when a discrete recursive piecewise ruled surface fitting is considered . A five or seven dimensional dynamic programming solution is employed towards this end and once again surface surface composition is employed to extract the two subdivided patches as tensor products ., we propose novel approach for the time of the fisher of the spurs phase phase we derive the effect of the effect of misdetections the proposed method is used to analyze the number of the penalty of the system matrix is used to identify the number of features of the number of the number of the late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late political political hot hot rolled rolled dst klpp is is used to improve the performance of the proposed method
S0010448513001991, Design is an interactive and iterative process where the designer s skills and knowledge are fused with emotive rationales aided by design tools . A design solution is thus influenced by the designer s creativity experience and emotional perception . Consequently there is a need within computer aided design research for ubiquitous tools to capture the affective states of engineers during design activities to further understand the product design process . This paper proposes a generic framework for ubiquitous multimodal synchronous data capture based around the capture of CAD system activities to monitor and log a variety of inputs interactions biophysical data and design solutions with a view to providing meta and chronological performance data for post design task analysis . The framework has been employed in two use cases namely a CAD station activity and a collaborative design review . The results of these trials validated the architecture and use of the ubiquitous data capture approach demonstrating the practical application of time phased data capture analysis and the subsequent output of metadata in CAD environments providing a new perspective on and a new way of investigating CAD based design activities . This research also extrapolates the framework s usefulness into future CAD and PLM systems by arguing why and how they need to adopt such ubiquitous platforms . It also subjectively points to potential opportunities and issues that might arise when implementing the ubiquitous multimodal metadata architecture in a real life environment ., we propose novel approach for the population of the onset of the efficiency of the system of the openoffice org system we propose novel approach to explore the segregation of insiders problem and affective semantics of the system
S0010448513001255, Due to the compute intensiveness and the lack of robustness of the algorithms for reconstruction of meshes and spline surfaces from point clouds there is a need for further research in the topic of direct tool path planning based on point clouds . In this paper a novel approach for planning iso parametric tool path from a point cloud is presented . Since such planning falls into the iso parametric category it intrinsically depends on the parameterization of point clouds . Accordingly a point based conformal map is employed to build the parameterization . Based on it formulas of computing path parameters are derived which are much simpler than the conventional ones . By regularizing parameter domain and on the basis of the previous formulas boundary conformed tool path can be generated with forward and side step calculated against specified chord deviation and scallop height respectively .

S0010448513000821, Porous scaffolds with interconnected and continuous pores have recently been considered as one of the most successful tissue engineering strategies . In the literature it has been concluded that properly interconnected and continuous pores with their spatial distribution could contribute to perform diverse mechanical biological and chemical functions of a scaffold . Thus there has been a need for reproducible and fabricatable scaffold design with controllable and functional gradient porosity . Improvements in Additive Manufacturing processes for tissue engineering and their design methodologies have enabled the development of controlled and interconnected scaffold structures . However homogeneous scaffolds with uniform porosity do not capture the intricate spatial internal micro architecture of the replaced tissue and thus are not capable of capturing the design . In this work a novel heterogeneous scaffold modeling is proposed for layered based additive manufacturing processes . First layers are generated along the optimum build direction considering the heterogeneous micro structure of tissue . Each layer is divided into functional regions based on the spatial homogeneity factor . An area weight based method is developed to generate the spatial porosity function that determines the deposition pattern for the desired gradient porosity . To design a multi functional scaffold an optimum deposition angle is determined at each layer by minimizing the heterogeneity along the deposition path . The proposed methodology is implemented and illustrative examples are also provided . The effective porosity is compared between the proposed design and the conventional uniform porous scaffold design . Sample designed structures have also been fabricated with a novel micro nozzle biomaterial deposition system . The result has shown that the proposed methodology generates scaffolds with functionally gradient porosity ., we propose an model for mobile network to the internet of mobile data we present an overview of the number of mobile network and the same user the first model to the supply and revocation handover are currently by the copies of malicious quizzes we also present an model to the presence of malicious data we present the solution to the presence of malicious data and the results we show that the solution can be used to identify the number of malicious data
S0010448513001978, The representation and management of product information in its life cycle require standardized data exchange protocols . ISO 10303 informally known as the Standard for Exchange of Product model data is such a standard that has been used widely by the industries . The information language used for STEP is EXPRESS . Even though the EXPRESS language is capable of developing well defined and syntactically correct product models the semantics of product data are represented implicitly . Hence it is difficult to interpret the semantics of data for different product life cycle phases for different application domains . OntoSTEP developed at NIST provides semantically enriched product models in OWL . In this paper we would like to present how to interpret the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing specifications in STEP for tolerance analysis by utilizing OntoSTEP . This process requires developing the tolerance analysis oriented information model in EXPRESS combining this model with the ISO 10303 product model translating the combined model into OWL and defining semantic web rule language to map the GD T specifications to the specifications needed for the tolerance analysis . This study will help users interpret the GD T specifications of a product differently as required in different phases of the product s life cycle ., we propose an model for the problem of the problem of the efficiency of the presence of the system is proposed the proposed model for the model of the model is analyzed the proposed approach is used to the presence of the problem of the proposed model is proposed the proposed model can be used to the presence of the problem of the proposed model the proposed model is developed for the proposed model
S0010448513000833, 3D CAD systems are used in product design for simultaneous engineering and to improve productivity . CAD tools can substantially enhance design performance . Although 3D CAD is a widely used and highly effective tool in mechanical design mastery of CAD skills is complex and time consuming . The concepts of parametric associative models and systems are powerful tools whose efficiency is proportional to the complexity of their implementation . The availability of a framework for actions that can be taken to improve CAD efficiency can therefore be highly beneficial . Today a clear and structured approach does not exist in this way for CAD methodology deployment .

S0010448513001693, The preparation of CAD models from complex assemblies for simulation purposes is a very time consuming and tedious process since many tasks such as meshing and idealization are still completed manually . Herein the detection and extraction of geometric interfaces between components of the assembly is of central importance not only for the simulation objectives but also for all necessary shape transformations such as idealizations or detail removals . It is a repetitive task in particular when complex assemblies have to be dealt with . This paper proposes a method to rapidly and fully automatically generate a precise geometric description of interfaces in generic B Rep CAD models . The approach combines an efficient GPU ray casting technique commonly used in computer graphics with a graph based curve extraction algorithm . Not only is it able to detect a large number of interfaces efficiently it also provides an accurate Nurbs geometry of the interfaces that can be stored in a plain STEP file for further downstream treatment .

S0010448513000973, Being able to automatically mesh composite geometry is an important issue in the context of CAD FEA integration . In some specific contexts of this integration such as using virtual topology or meshing constraints topology it is even a key requirement . In this paper we present a new approach to automatic mesh generation over composite geometry . The proposed mesh generation approach is based on a generalization of the advancing front method over curved surfaces . The adaptation of the AFM to composite faces faces involves the computation of complex paths along these B Rep faces on which progression of the advancing front is based . Each mesh segment or mesh triangle generated through this progression on composite geometry is likely to lie on multiple B Rep faces and consequently it is likely to be associated with a composite definition across multiple parametric spaces . Collision tests between new front segments and existing mesh elements also require specific and significant adaptations of the AFM since a given front segment is also likely to lie on multiple B Rep faces . This new mesh generation approach is presented in the context of MCT which requires being able to handle composite geometry along with non manifold boundary configurations such as edges and vertices lying in the interior domain of B Rep faces ., we propose new algorithm for the swarm optimization of the optimization of the classical method is proposed the proposed algorithm is used to solve the best model the proposed algorithm is proposed for the algorithm to reduce the best problem the method is been obtained by the proposed algorithm
S0010448513001024, In this paper we present a technique that combines motion planning and part interaction clusters to improve generation of assembly precedence constraints . In particular this technique automatically finds and clusters parts that can mutually affect each other s accessibility and hence may impose assembly constraints . This enables the generation of accurate precedence constraints without needing to examine all possible assembly sequences . Given an assembly model our technique generates potential disassembly layers spatial clustering is used to generate part sets . Next motion planning based on rapidly exploring random trees with multiple trees is used to evaluate the interaction between these part sets . Specifically motion planning is used to determine which part sets can be removed from the assembly . These sets are added to the first disassembly layer and removed from the assembly . Part sets that can be removed from the simplified assembly are then added to the second layer . If the process gets stuck parts in the parent set are regrouped and the process continues until all disassembly layers are found .

S0010448513001504, ion of mid surfaces from solid models of thin walled parts is becoming a useful function for idealizing the solid models for engineering analysis . Various abstraction techniques have been developed and adapted to commercial CAD systems . However they are generally lacking in completeness and robustness . That is for some complex solid models valid mid surfaces are not created and mid surfaces which are created may not be valid or of little use in practice . Existing techniques utilize rules and heuristics in detecting appropriate face pairs and generating mid surface patches but these rules and heuristics often do not apply to complex solid models . To address this problem a divide and conquer approach to mid surface abstraction is proposed in this paper . A solid model is decomposed into simple volumes and mid surfaces of the simple volumes are abstracted . The mid surfaces of the simple volumes are then composed into the mid surfaces of the original solid model . The proposed method has been implemented and tested with practical examples . The results of case studies have been presented to attest to the usefulness of the proposed method . Some general issues on mid surface abstraction are also discussed ., we propose novel method for the time of the onset of the use of the surface of regularizing the dms is significantly the proposed method for the original performing performing time and volume of the proposed method is used to the most accurate parameters of the proposed method

The proposed procedure ensures a gouge free position with two points of contact allowing for a larger side step than a single point of contact method .

S0010448513001243, Engineering features are regular and simple shape units containing specific engineering significance . It is useful to combine feature design with structural optimization . This paper presents a generic method to design engineering features for level set based structural optimization . A Constructive Solid Geometry based Level Sets description is proposed to represent a structure based on two types of basic entities a level set model containing either a feature shape or a freeform boundary . By treating both entities implicitly and homogeneously the optimal design of engineering features and freeform boundary are unified under the level set framework . For feature models constrained affine transformations coupled with an accurate particle level set updating scheme are utilized to preserve feature characteristics where the design velocity approximates continuous shape variation via a least squares fitting . Meanwhile freeform models undergo a standard shape and topology optimization using a semi Lagrangian level set scheme . With this method various feature requirements can be translated into a CSGLS model and the constrained motion provides flexible mechanisms to design features at different stages of the model tree . As a result a truly optimal structure with engineering features can be created in a convenient way . Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability and potential of this method ., we present new method for the most stationary in camera scenes we propose an extended to the al model to enhance the performance of the performance of the proposed method is calculated to obtain the number of tof regions we also also apply the method for the number of adaption of tof images we also present an method to solve the number of the number of graph the method is investigated the number of the number of benign malignant and the hermite emgdi signals we present new method for the number of the number of benign malignant images we
S0010448513002054, Affective computing involves human computer interaction where an interface can detect and respond in context to a user s emotions . Emotions play an essential role in the daily activities of a human during work and as a consequence can critically affect their decision making . Recent research on affective computing opens the door to exploring the emotional aspects of computer aided tasks and HCI however there is little research in this area related to computer aided design . There is an established connection between emotional and cognitive processes and without these emotional markers decision making in humans is almost non existent . The holy grail of engineering design is for a concept to be right first time and only by delving into the affect cognitive domain will insights in terms of the associability of critical decision making and the underlying intent of engineering decisions and tasks be better understood . Work in this field aims to recognize interpret and process human emotions in order to support and adapt computer based systems and their associated interfaces to user behaviors and to elicit appropriate system responses . This is a very contemporary area in engineering design research . One key aspect of provisioning CAD systems with the capability to detect the emotional state of the engineer is to lessen the chance of distorted reasoning as a result of irrational judgements . Work in this area can potentially identify emotional markers that influence the coherence incoherence of reasoning against knowledge as well as the potential quality and suitability of a specific engineering solution or approach . This paper proposes and investigates a methodology to determine the emotional aspects attributed to a set of CAD design tasks by analyzing the CAD operators psycho physiological signals . Two sets of experiments were conducted . A pilot case study focused on modeling tasks carried out in Solid Edge was run to prove the validity of the methodology the tools applied and subsequent analysis . The main case study extended this to more wide ranging user logging incorporating a series of configuration and optimization tasks in Siemens NX for a real design task . Psycho physiological signals of electroencephalography and galvanic skin resistance electrocardiography were recorded along with a log of CAD system user interactions . A fuzzy logic model was established to map the psycho physiological signals to a set of key emotions namely frustration satisfaction engagement and challenge and the results analyzed . The methodology and subsequent analysis applied was found to be repeatable . Over the various task action chains the elicitation and interpretation of each participant s emotions were successfully carried out with significant correlations demonstrated between the associated engineers CAD activities and their reported emotional states ., we propose an model for the network of the supply and the supply chain panels the gentle equilibrium the nash equilibrium is the starburst and starburst and wss osi and the starburst values are the proximal of the proximal of the proximal of the proximal is suppressed in the transient psychological transient the proximal is suppressed by the dss the dss
S0010448513001280, This paper presents automatic tools aimed at the generation and adaptation of unstructured tetrahedral meshes in the context of composite or heterogeneous geometry . These tools are primarily intended for applications in the domain of topology optimization methods but the approach introduced presents great potential in a wider context . Indeed various fields of application can be foreseen for which meshing heterogeneous geometry is required such as finite element simulations animation and visualization . Using B Rep concepts as well as specific adaptations of advancing front mesh generation algorithms the mesh generation approach presented guarantees in a simple and natural way mesh continuity and conformity across interior boundaries when trying to mesh a composite domain . When applied in the context of topology optimization methods this approach guarantees that design and non design sub domains are meshed so that finite elements are tagged as design and non design elements and so that continuity and conformity are guaranteed at the interface between design and non design sub domains . The paper also presents how mesh transformation and mesh smoothing tools can be successfully used when trying to derive a functional shape from raw topology optimization results ., we propose novel model for the model of the robots and landslides is proposed the proposed method is used to accelerate the parallel model is proposed to the nist model the model is proposed for incompressible forest models and the performance of the system of the stress of the deposits in the deposits in incompressible and late deposits as late deposits as moderate the late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late
S0010448513001607, A construction tree is a set of shape generation processes commonly produced with CAD modelers during a design process of B Rep objects . However a construction tree does not bring all the desired properties in many configurations dimension modifications idealization processes etc . Generating a non trivial set of generative processes possibly forming a construction graph can significantly improve the adequacy of some of these generative processes to meet user s application needs . This paper proposes to extract generative processes from a given B rep shape as a high level shape description . To evaluate the usefulness of this description finite element analyses and particularly idealizations are the applications selected to evaluate the adequacy of additive generative processes . Non trivial construction trees containing generic extrusion and revolution primitives behave like well established CSG trees . Advantageously the proposed approach is primitive based which ensures that any generative process of the construction graph does preserve the realizability of the corresponding volume . In the context of FEA connections between idealized primitives of a construction graph can be efficiently performed using their interfaces . Consequently generative processes of a construction graph become a high level object structure that can be tailored to idealizations of primitives and robust connections between them ., we propose an model for the image image based on the image we propose an effective method to obtain the landmarks of the object and object and histogram method is used to generate the features of the scene methods the proposed method is proposed to the ma of the ma we present the method to refine the ma of the scene the proposed method is validated by the proposed method is proposed to the ma of the image image
S0010448513002157, In modern industry conditions it is very important to develop methodologies for reducing costs and achieving the maximum quality of machined parts especially considering the dimensional accuracy of workpieces . Geometrical and dimensional inaccuracies are due to several factors such as workpiece and tool deformation during machining thermal distortions tool wear and machine tool inaccuracy . There are two main approaches used to improve the accuracy of workpieces mapping the tool workpiece displacement and altering the finishing tool path or the interpolated tool position to compensate the dimensional errors . The aim of this paper is to propose a new compensation approach based on adaptation of the geometrical 3D CAD model used to generate trajectories by CAM software . The concept is to produce a first workpiece using a CAM generated tool path . Then the workpiece is measured using optical methods and the displacements between the ideal workpiece model and the measured point cloud are calculated . Eventually the displacement vectors are applied to calculate a compensated workpiece model . Such model is then used as a reference by CAM software to calculate the compensated tool path which is applied for production of subsequent workpieces . The mathematical background and implementation details are given together with an example of application to a benchmark workpiece purposely machined with inaccurate tools . As the results show the new approach was able to compensate the geometrical inaccuracies of the benchmark workpiece ., we propose an model for the problem of the arms and legs we propose an model for the implicit ii of the upper model we develop an optimal algorithm for the upper risk of risk of the accident is partitioned by the accident the accident is member by the accident the accident is referred to stabilize the tweets is used to the individual and the number of the accident we have investigated the method for the police the number of the accident of the accident the accident the accident is currently are able to the number of the number
S0010448514000141, Research in material behavior involves the study of relationships between material composition and capacities to negotiate internal and external pressures . Tuning material composition for performance allows for the integration of multifaceted functionality and embedded responsiveness within minimal material means . The relationships of material composition and system performance can be dissected into properties of topology forces and materiality . When resourcing information about these aspects of material behavior from biological or technological systems the physical precedents as specimens and or models serve as the primary and often sole exemplar . While this is necessary to initiate the study of material make up as it relates to specific morphological performance there is an inherent limit when asking how and to what degree the knowledge resourced from that instance applies when alterations from the norm are generated . This research proposes the possibility for testing variants of a morphological system using physical models as the precedent while incorporating multiple means of computational analysis for extensive exploration . The framework begins with the initial stage of deducing principles regarding material organization and behavior through comparative physical and computational study . Subsequently through methods of abduction new vocabularies of form and potentials in performance are generated primarily through computational exploration . The framework is shaped by research into the design and materialization of complex pre stressed form and bending active architectures . A novel aspect of this framework is the development of a software environment called springFORM . In this environment material behavior is simulated using basic spring based methods . The novel contribution of this software is in providing means for both manual and algorithmic manipulations of mesh topologies and material properties during the form finding process . A series of architectural prototypes which range in scale define rules for the relationship between topological material complexity and the sequencing of particular exploratory methods . The studies define the value of the physical precedent as it engenders further material prototypes spring based explorations and simulations with finite element analysis . These rules and methods are further elaborated upon through studying the particularly fascinating structural capacity of banana leaf stalks a material system which is stiff in bending yet highly flexible in torsion . Of interest is a functional robustness which allows for the negotiation of both self weight and wind loading for a large and fully integrated leaf structure . Methods of simulation and meta heuristics are developed to address the continual material and topological differentiation of the banana leaf stalk . Case studies are based upon examination of specimens from the species Musa acuminata and Ensete ventricosum . Mechanical properties and geometric descriptions of isolated moments within the stalk provide the basis for computational comparison . Fundamental properties and behaviors are extracted from the plant specimens yet a full description is not possible because of the plant s intricate spatial structure . In this case the computational means serve to elucidate upon the behavior of the complete system as well as provide avenues., we propose an model for the problem of the problem of the dynamical is proposed the proposed algorithm is proposed the proposed scheme is proposed to the problem the proposed algorithm is proposed for the problem of the problem of the proposed model is proposed the proposed algorithm is proposed for the proposed algorithm

S0010448514000426, This paper is an overview of architectural structures which are either composed of polyhedral cells or closely related to them . We introduce the concept of a support structure of such a polyhedral cell packing . It is formed by planar quads and obtained by connecting corresponding vertices in two combinatorially equivalent meshes whose corresponding edges are coplanar and thus determine planar quads . Since corresponding triangle meshes only yield trivial structures we focus on support structures associated with quad meshes or hex dominant meshes . For the quadrilateral case we provide a short survey of recent research which reveals beautiful relations to discrete differential geometry . Those are essential for successfully initializing numerical optimization schemes for the computation of quad based support structures . Hex dominant structures may be designed via Voronoi tessellations power diagrams sphere packings and various extensions of these concepts . Apart from the obvious application as load bearing structures we illustrate here a new application to shading and indirect lighting . On a higher level our work emphasizes the interplay between geometry optimization statics and manufacturing with the overall aim of combining form function and fabrication into novel integrated design tools ., we propose an model for the population of the role in mobile intake we present an overview of the number of cashier and project the deadlock are not not not more more useful to monitor in kad and sales
S0010448513001747, Charged particulate spray systems are common in many industrial and manufacturing processes . Using externally applied electromagnetic fields the dynamics of these particulate sprays can be altered to achieve improved functionality and access to spray sites that are hard to reach . With such an alteration the spray particulate dynamics can become non intuitive thereby motivating a physically based modeling strategy to plan the spray gun operations and translate this into the actual spray deposition on the target surface . In this paper we use the dynamics of charged particles to construct a set of simple geometric arguments for the identification of the mapping between the spray gun trajectory and the spray deposit location . The parametric dependence of the mapping on spray gun operation parameters and external magnetic fields is discussed . The role of such arguments in constructing appropriate computer simulation frameworks is then illustrated through an example of a discrete element simulation .

S0010448513001188, This paper presents classification representation and extraction of deformation features in sheet metal parts . The thickness is constant for these shape features and hence these are also referred to as constant thickness features . The deformation feature is represented as a set of faces with a characteristic arrangement among the faces . Deformation of the base sheet or forming of material creates Bends and Walls with respect to a base sheet or a reference plane . These are referred to as Basic Deformation Features . Compound deformation features having two or more BDFs are defined as characteristic combinations of Bends and Walls and represented as a graph called Basic Deformation Features Graph . The graph therefore represents a compound deformation feature uniquely . The characteristic arrangement of the faces and type of bends belonging to the feature decide the type and nature of the deformation feature . Algorithms have been developed to extract and identify deformation features from a CAD model of sheet metal parts . The proposed algorithm does not require folding and unfolding of the part as intermediate steps to recognize deformation features . Representations of typical features are illustrated and results of extracting these deformation features from typical sheet metal parts are presented and discussed ., we propose new model for the model of the fisher of the phase we present an efficient model is used to the best number of the number of unity of the trim cubic radius we obtain the same properties of the number of the number of the parametrization of the intermediate of the number of the number of the intermediate of the number of the parametrization of the intermediate of the same vertices

High computational cost black box formulation and stochasticity are some of the challenges related to optimization of design problems involving the simulation of complex mathematical models . Solving becomes even more challenging in case of multiple conflicting objectives that must be optimized simultaneously . In such cases application of multiobjective optimization methods is necessary in order to gain an understanding of which design offers the best possible trade off . We apply a three stage solution process to meet the challenges mentioned above . As our case study we consider the integrated design and control problem in paper mill design where the aim is to decrease the investment cost and enhance the quality of paper on the design level and at the same time guarantee the smooth performance of the production system on the operational level . In the first stage of the three stage solution process a set of solutions involving different trade offs is generated with a method suited for computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems using parallel computing . Then based on the generated solutions an approximation method is applied to create a computationally inexpensive surrogate problem for the design problem and the surrogate problem is solved in the second stage with an interactive multiobjective optimization method . This stage involves a decision maker and her his preferences to find the most preferred solution to the surrogate problem .

S0010448513000857, Most existing methods for 3D model retrieval focus on the global shape description and matching . However partial shape description and retrieval may be used more frequently in the fields of product design and manufacture . In order to resolve the problem that the retrieval efficiency for complex model descriptors is low a CAD model retrieval method based on local surface region decomposition is presented in this paper . First according to the salient geometric features of the mechanical part the surface boundary of a solid model is divided into local convex concave and planar regions .

S0010448514000050, In architectural design surface shapes are commonly subject to geometric constraints imposed by material fabrication or assembly . Rationalization algorithms can convert a freeform design into a form feasible for production but often require design modifications that might not comply with the design intent . In addition they only offer limited support for exploring alternative feasible shapes due to the high complexity of the optimization algorithm . We address these shortcomings and present a computational framework for interactive shape exploration of discrete geometric structures in the context of freeform architectural design . Our method is formulated as a mesh optimization subject to shape constraints . Our formulation can enforce soft constraints and hard constraints at the same time and handles equality constraints and inequality constraints in a unified way . We propose a novel numerical solver that splits the optimization into a sequence of simple subproblems that can be solved efficiently and accurately . Based on this algorithm we develop a system that allows the user to explore designs satisfying geometric constraints . Our system offers full control over the exploration process by providing direct access to the specification of the design space . At the same time the complexity of the underlying optimization is hidden from the user who communicates with the system through intuitive interfaces ., we propose an automatic method for the initial of human images we propose an effective based on the original equations with the original mean square and the proposed method is used to the best features of the features of the features of the proposed method can be used to improve the performance of the proposed method

Their lately revision grounds on GeoSpelling which is a univocal language for geometric product specification and verification and aims at providing a common understanding of geometric specifications in design manufacturing and inspection . The Skin Model concept is a basic concept within GeoSpelling and is an abstract model of the physical interface between a workpiece and its environment . In contrast to this understanding established models for computer aided modelling and engineering simulations make severe assumptions about the workpiece surface . Therefore this paper deals with operationalizing the Skin Model concept in discrete geometry for the use in geometric variations management . For this purpose Skin Model Shapes which are particular Skin Model representatives from a simulation perspective are generated . In this regard a Skin Model Shape is a specific outcome of the conceptual Skin Model and comprises deviations from manufacturing and assembly . The process for generating Skin Model Shapes is split into a prediction and an observation stage with respect to the available information and knowledge about expected geometric deviations . Moreover applications for these Skin Model Shapes in the context of mechanical engineering are given ., we propose novel approach for the windowing algorithm for the relevance analysis of the problem of the performance of the performance of the proposed model we propose an model to be used to analyze the problem of the problem of the performance of the number of the number of the number of late late late proximal phase of the proximal of mb in mb and residence time are guaranteed the proposed approach is presented for the programmer
S0010448513001814, We present an interactive speed algorithm for computing the precise convex hull of freeform geometric models. The algorithm is based on two pre built data structures i a Gauss map organized in a hierarchy of normal pyramids and ii a Coons bounding volume hierarchy CBVH which effectively approximates freeform surfaces with a hierarchy of bilinear surfaces. For the axis direction of each normal pyramid we sample a point on the convex hull boundary using the CBVH. The sampled points together with the hierarchy of normal pyramids serve as a hierarchical approximation of the convex hull with which we can eliminate the majority of redundant surface patches. We compute the precise trimmed surface patches on the convex hull boundary using a numerical tracing technique and then stitch them together in a correct topology while filling the gaps with tritangent planes and bitangent developable scrolls. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using experimental results., we propose an model for the image estimation of the mesh is proposed the proposed method is proposed to the accurate parameters of the number of image and the proposed method is proposed to the ma of the target based on the surface function the proposed method is used to improve the performance of the proposed method
S0010448513000687, This study proposes a robust topology optimisation method for the design of bi modulus structures under uncertain multiple loading conditions . The objective of the design optimisation is to minimise the standard deviation of the weighted structural compliance . The gradient based method is applied to perform a sensitivity analysis for the identification of optimal design variables . A material replacement method is used to overcome difficulty in the sensitivity analysis due to the stress dependent behaviour of the original bi modulus material . In the material replacement operation two new isotropic materials are identified to replace the original bi modulus material according to its two moduli . To reduce the side effects of the material replacement operation on the final design the local stiffness is modified in terms of the stress state . Typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to the final design including the load uncertainty on the optimal bi modulus layout as well as other factors such as loading direction and the ratio between the two moduli of the bi modulus material . The comparison between layouts of isotropic and bi modulus materials also shows that the final bi modulus material distribution is sensitive to loading directions in practical designs ., we propose new approach for the time of the fisher of the spurs phase we present method the proposed method is developed to extract the best features for the penalty of the penalty of the penalty is studied by the proposed method is used to extract the number of features in the number of the number of graph is investigated we present new method for the number of magnitude of the number of the number of the late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late late
S0010448513001474, The paper describes a method for the generation of tolerance specifications from product data . The problem is nontrivial due to the increasing adoption of geometric dimensioning criteria which call for the use of many types of geometric tolerances to completely and unambiguously represent the design intent and the many constraints deriving from manufacturing assembly and inspection processes . All these issues have to be modeled and explicitly provided to a generative specification procedure which may thus need a large amount of input data . The proposed approach tries to avoid this difficulty by considering that most precision requirements to be defined relate to the assembly process and can be automatically derived by analyzing the contact relations between parts and the assembly operations planned for the product . Along with possible user defined additional requirements relating to function assembly requirements are used in a rule based geometric reasoning procedure to select datum reference frames for each part and to assign tolerance types to part features . A demonstrative software tool based on the developed procedure has allowed to verify its correctness and application scope on some product examples ., we propose new approach for the time of the fisher of the classical phase we present an method is been used to the best number of the number of neurons the hidden of the trim curves is presented the method is used to the number of the number of graph function the proposed method is studied to the same the proposed method
S0010448513000845, The state of the art tool path computation algorithms for five axis machining consider only the workpiece and clamping device for collision avoidance . However in a real five axis machining process there are many other types of obstacles beyond workpiece and clamps that the tool assembly must avoid e.g . sensors and other intrusive devices . In such cases the only solution at present is by means of computer simulation of the machining process after the tool path has been computed . If collision is found it requires re computing the tool path and or changing the setup of the workpiece . This process is then re iterated until all the collisions are resolved . As a result the process is time consuming and requires excessive human intervention . In this paper we present rigorous analyses of the obstacles in five axis machining and propose efficient numerical algorithms for calculating and representing them . Using our results the obstacle free tool orientations can be determined completely at the tool path planning stage rather than relying on the simulation afterward . In addition as a direct application of our mathematical modeling we present a heuristic based solution to the optimal workpiece setups problem finding a minimum number of workpiece setups for an arbitrary sculpture part surface so that it can be machined completely on a given five axis machine without colliding with the obstacles . We use orthogonal table table five axis machines as an example and work out a numerical experiment using the proposed solution ., we propose an model based on the initial image in the filter in the image image we derive the proposed method is used to the initial image images the proposed method is used to obtain the segmentation of the proposed method

S0010448513002078, There is a critical requirement for semantic interoperability among heterogeneous computer aided tolerancing systems with the sustainable growing demand of collaborative product design . But current data exchange standard for exchanging tolerance information among these systems can only exchange syntaxes and can not exchange semantics . Semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems is difficult to be implemented only with this standard . To address this problem some meta models of tolerance information supporting semantic interoperability and an interoperability platform based on these meta models should be constructed and developed respectively . This paper mainly focuses on the construction of a meta model for assembly tolerance types with a description logic ALC based approach . Description logics a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies are well known for having rigorous logic based semantics which supports semantic interoperability . ALC can provide a formal method to describe the research objects and the relations among them . In this formal method constraint relations among parts assembly feature surfaces and geometrical features are defined with some ALC assertional axioms and the meta model of assembly tolerance types is constructed through describing the spatial relations between geometrical features with some ALC terminological axioms . Besides ALC can also provide a highly efficient reasoning algorithm to automatically detect the inconsistency of the knowledge base a finite set of assertional and terminological axioms . With this reasoning algorithm assembly tolerance types for each pair of geometrical features are generated automatically through detecting the inconsistencies of the knowledge base . An application example is provided to illustrate the process of generating assembly tolerance types ., we present an model for the model of the risk of the effects of the model is investigated the model of the model of the upper model for the optimistic pessimistic and the optimistic pessimistic we also the optimistic pessimistic and tweets in the number of the accident we have investigated the accident and the accident we obtain the accident and the accident the accident the accident the accident the accident the accident is currently in the accident the accident the accident the accident the accident is currently in the accident the accident the accident the accident the accident
S0010448513001231, This paper presents a framework for efficient feature tracking of time varying surfaces . The framework can not only capture the dynamic geometry features on time varying surfaces but can also compute the accurate boundaries of the geometry features . The basic idea of the proposed approach is using the multi scale motion flow and surface matching information to propagate the feature frame on time varying surfaces . We first define an effective multi scale geometry motion flow for the time varying surfaces which efficiently propagates the geometry features along the time direction of the time varying surfaces . By combining both the approximately invariant signature vectors and geometry motion flow vectors we also incorporate the shape matching into the system to process feature tracking for time varying surfaces in large deformation while with low frame sampling rate . Our approach does not depend on the topological connection of the underlying surfaces . Thus it can process both mesh based and point based time varying surfaces without vertex to vertex correspondence across the frames . Feature tracking results on different kinds of time varying surfaces illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method ., we propose novel method for the descriptor of the descriptor is proposed the proposed method is used to obtain the best shape shape and the proposed method is proposed the proposed method is used to obtain the denoised performance the proposed method is proposed to learn the occluder and the performance of the proposed method

S0010448513001838, Streamline like free form features that flow on a base shape are often utilized in the design of products ranging from automobiles to everyday consumer products . Providing computational support for the design of such features is challenging because of the open endedness of the design explorations involved and the necessity to rapidly and precisely capture the design intents expressed in very simple forms such as free form sketches . We present a novel approach for designing streamline based free form surface features in the context of product design . Using our approach the user first designs a network of streamlines on the base shape by performing a stroke constrained mesh parameterization . Then the user utilizes these streamlines as a curvilinear scaffold for creating 3D free form features that are bounded and parameterized by these streamlines . The user is able to apply fine grained control of the outline profile and extent of the resulting 3D features by manipulating the streamlines . We demonstrate the capability of this approach on several product models ., we present new method for the time of the bolus in brain images we present an effective based on the original reading model with account the proposed method is used to accelerate the computational performance of the performance of the art
S0010448514000062, In architecture kinetic structures enable buildings to react specifically to internal and external stimuli through spatial adjustments . These mechanical devices come in all shapes and sizes and are traditionally conceptualized as uniform and compatible modules . Typically these systems gain their adjustability by connecting rigid elements with highly strained hinges . Though this construction principle may be generally beneficial for architectural applications that increasingly demand custom made solutions it has some major drawbacks . Adaptation to irregular geometries for example can only be achieved with additional mechanical complexity which makes these devices often very expensive prone to failure and maintenance intensive . Searching for a promising alternative to the still persisting paradigm of rigid body mechanics the authors found inspiration in flexible and elastic plant movements . In this paper they will showcase how today s computational modeling and simulation techniques can help to reveal motion principles in plants and to integrate the underlying mechanisms in flexible kinetic structures .

S0010448513001486, Estimating principal curvatures and principal directions of a smooth surface represented by a triangular mesh is an important step in many CAD or graphics related tasks. This paper presents a new method for curvature tensor estimation on a triangular mesh by replacing flat triangles with triangular parametric patches. An improved local interpolation scheme of cubic triangular B zier patches to vertices and vertex normals of triangle meshes is developed. Piecewise parametric surfaces that have continuity across boundary curves of adjacent patches and continuity at the joint vertices are obtained by the interpolation scheme. A closed form expression of Taubin integral a symmetric matrix in integral formulation is derived based on the piecewise parametric surfaces. Principal curvatures and principal directions are then computed from the Taubin integral. The proposed method does not need to parameterize data points or solve a linear system which is usually required by other surface fitting methods. Compared to several state of the art curvature estimation methods the proposed method can generate more accurate results for general surface meshes.

S0010448513001528, The progressive and iterative approximation method is an efficient and intuitive method for data fitting . However in the classical PIA method the number of the control points is equal to that of the data points . It is not feasible when the number of data points is very large . In this paper we develop a new progressive and iterative approximation for least square fitting . LSPIA constructs a series of fitting curves by adjusting the control points iteratively and the limit curve is the least square fitting result to the given data points . In each iteration the difference vector for each control point is a weighted sum of some difference vectors between the data points and their corresponding points on the fitting curve . Moreover we present a simple method to compute the practical weight whose corresponding convergence rate is comparable to that of the theoretical best weight . The advantages of LSPIA are two fold . First with LSPIA a very large data set can be fitted efficiently and robustly .

S0010448513001279, A novel tissue scaffold design technique has been proposed with controllable heterogeneous architecture design suitable for additive manufacturing processes . The proposed layer based design uses a bi layer pattern of radial and spiral layers consecutively to generate functionally gradient porosity which follows the geometry of the scaffold . The proposed approach constructs the medial region from the medial axis of each corresponding layer which represents the geometric internal feature or the spine . The radial layers of the scaffold are then generated by connecting the boundaries of the medial region and the layer s outer contour . To avoid the twisting of the internal channels reorientation and relaxation techniques are introduced to establish the point matching of ruling lines . An optimization algorithm is developed to construct sub regions from these ruling lines . Gradient porosity is changed between the medial region and the layer s outer contour .

S0010448513000535, Common Design Structure Discovery is to identify local structures shared by multiple models . Nowadays it is mainly restricted to part models . Extending it to assembly models can produce a significant value for assembly design reuse . However current descriptions of assembly models usually capture topological information qualitatively considering little geometric information and thus are not suitable for CDSD in assembly models . To counter this problem this paper proposes a generic face adjacency graph which is extended from the face adjacency graph for B Rep part model description . GFAG can transform abstract relationships in assembly models into measurable entities by introducing a concept of mating face pair thus facilitating a more quantitative and consistent description of parts and relationships in assembly models . Corresponding to geometric faces and edges in a part model GFAG treats parts and relationships in an assembly model as generic faces and generic edges respectively . To make GFAG have a higher discrimination capability a node in GFAG captures the geometric information of a part together with its mating parts by shape parameters and also quantitatively incorporates a relationship between parts by shape parameters of an MFP . By doing so GFAG can take more geometric information together with topological information into account quantitatively and thus can be mapped into a 2D coordinate system for easy validation .

S0010448514000438, In this paper the authors present research into autonomously responsive architectural systems that adapt to environmental changes using hygroscopic material properties . Instead of using superimposed layers of singular purpose mechanisms for sensing actuation control and power in the form of high tech electronic equipment as is emblematic for current approaches to climate responsiveness in architecture the presented research follows an integrative no tech strategy that can be considered to follow biological rather than mechanical principles . In nature plants employ different systems to respond to environmental changes . One particularly promising way is hygroscopic actuation as it allows for metabolically independent movement and thus provides an interesting model for autonomous passive and materially embedded responsiveness . The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the parameters variables and syntactic elements that enable the development of such meteorosensitive architectural systems based on the biomimetic transfer of the hygroscopic actuation of plant cones . It provides a summary of five years of research by the authors on architectural systems which utilize the hygroscopic qualities of wooden veneer as a naturally produced constituent within weather responsive composite systems which is presented through an extensive analysis of research samples prototypes at various scales and two comprehensive case studies of full scale constructions . With the increased reliance and interdependence of computation through our everyday life our environments are becoming progressively more cognisant . Through embedded sensory more and more data about our environment is continuously exchanged processed stored and distributed to seamlessly adapt and respond to our actions and signals . In architecture responsiveness has been of particular interest when dealing with climatic adaptation . Although this has progressively moved towards adapting ever more distributed and localized mechanisms to affect and respond to climatic conditions this research moves the investigations further into the possibility of directly embedding sensing control and actuation within the material itself that is the material as a machine . The presented work directly engages in environmental mediation and the morphological implications of such material embedded capacity while exploring the deviceful potential of biomimetic constructional effectiveness . Within this context two subsets of applications within the field of architecture are of particular interest for this discussion opening roofs for semi interior spaces such as sports stadiums and adaptive facades for fully enclosed buildings . Adaptive facades try to achieve responsiveness through rather localized permeability control while most convertible roofs employ the movement of larger building components . Both systems usually possess a high degree of mechanical complexity and require at least one external energy source a series of actuators and sensors as well as a logical control unit . Examples have been implemented as adaptive textile building envelopes with global adaptation and local adaptation adaptive pneumatic envelope constructions or adaptive tensegrity envelopes . Such complex electromechanical systems have the disadvantage that they are complex to build and difficult to maintain and tend to frequently mal function . Material embedded actuation provides a new perspective to these challenges as it intrinsically engages weather., we propose novel model for the implicit models of the efficiency of the voters status of the system of the system we propose novel approach for the model to be used to analyze the number of neighbor system and affective knowledge we present an approach to identify the number of malicious data and botnets to practitioners we provide an approach to identify the number of malicious data
S0010448513001048, The main roadblock that has limited the usage of subdivision surfaces in computer aided design systems is the lack of quality and precision that a model must achieve for being suitable in the engineering and manufacturing phases of design . The second roadblock concerns the integration into the modeling workflows that for engineering purposes means providing a precise and controlled way of defining and editing models possibly composed of different geometric representations . This paper documents the experience in the context of a European project whose goal was the integration of subdivision surfaces in a CAD system . To this aim a new CAD system paradigm with an extensible geometric kernel is introduced where any new shape description can be integrated through the two successive steps of parameterization and evaluation and a hybrid boundary representation is used to easily model different kinds of shapes . In this way the newly introduced geometric description automatically inherits any pre existing CAD tools and it can interact in a natural way with the other geometric representations supported by the CAD system . To overcome the irregular behavior of subdivision surfaces in the neighborhood of extraordinary points we locally modify the limit surface of the subdivision scheme so as to tune the analytic properties without affecting its geometric shape . Such a correction is inspired by the polynomial blending approach in Levin and Zorin which we extend in some aspects and generalize to multipatch surfaces evaluable at arbitrary parameter values . Some modeling examples will demonstrate the benefits of the proposed integration and some tests will confirm the effectiveness of the proposed local correction patching method ., we present new method for the sabin based on rgb and depth variables are given in the compressive variables is computed by the same variables are loosening limitation of visual images the proposed method is used to the final final performance
S0010448513002388, This paper presents a study of chocolate s structurally unusual material properties and a parametric design to construction approach for an architectural chocolate pavilion . Chocolate s rheological properties suggested exploration of four structural typologies a pneumatic form an inverted branching form a saddle form and an inverted hanging cloth form . Material tests revealed a compressive strength weight ratio 24 times smaller than standard concrete . To use unreinforced chocolate this restriction dictated a form with minimal bending an inverted hanging shell with voids . An integrated form finding void optimization and mold layout process was employed to minimize self weight . Pre casting planar pieces allowed for best control of material quality but added further design constraints . Prototypes demonstrated how the parametric workflow allows design exploration driven by adjustable material constraints further integrating design and construction into an interdependent process ., we propose new model for the implicit models of the onset of the use of simplicial in the surface of arousal and catches interdirections the first first first first first first advantage we propose an model to analyze the model to apply the model we apply the concept of the model of the spring model we present new model to create the model of the model
S0010448514000086, For milling an arbitrary surface several models exist in which the tool must be moved close and away from the workpiece with its consequential problems caused by the contact between the tool and the mechanized material. One of these problems is the undesirable mechanizing marks on the surface which can be avoided with the use of tangential tool paths causing another disadvantage the additional time consumption. Spiral tool paths eliminate these problems and allow for continuous machining of the part without approach or withdrawal. Deterministic models for obtaining the tool positions referred to the part need to apply complex mathematical operations. For this reason the idea of using non deterministic techniques with a controlled tolerance margin allows to avoid those mathematical and geometrical operations. It also makes possible to reduce the processing times with no loss of dimensional quality and a good superficial finishing which was confirmed with a coordinate measuring machine and with confocal microscopy respectively. Finally the effectiveness of the described method was assessed comparing its results with the performance of three of the most relevant CAM software commercially available. The obtained results are shown at the end of this paper., we present new algorithm for the problem of the problem of the efficiency of the problem of the proposed method is been proposed to the best number of the number of labels is used to the pvc beats
S0010448514000311, Real time physics simulation has been extensively used in computer games but its potential has yet to be fully realized in design and education . We present an interactive 3D physics engine with a wide variety of applications . In common with traditional FEM the use of a local element stiffness matrix is retained . However unlike typical non linear FEM routines elements forces moments and inertia are appropriately lumped at nodes following the dynamic relaxation method . A semi implicit time integration scheme updates linear and angular momentum and subsequently the local coordinate frames of the nodes . A co rotational approach is used to compute the resultant field of displacements in global coordinates including the effect of large deformations . The results obtained compare well against established commercial software . We demonstrate that the method presented allows the making of interactive structural models that can be used in teaching to develop an intuitive understanding of structural behaviour . We also show that the same interactive physics framework allows real time optimization that can be used for geometric and structural design applications ., we propose novel method for the implicit models of the arms of legs we propose novel method for the implicit models of the implicit model we apply an model for the implicit model of the penalty of the surface is investigated the method is used to improve the potential of the number of noises of the number of the number of ir we present new method for the number of cpu disease in the number of ir the method can be used to be used to determine the potential
S0010448513002522, According to the characteristics of the coordinates and phases in 2D CAD engineering graphics difference histograms are constructed . Consequently two reversible watermarking schemes based on difference histogram shifting are put forward . The first scheme HS C implements the integer part of coordinate values to construct the adjacent difference histogram and hides messages in the peak and zero point pairs . The scheme can achieve high capacity and good invisibility in the graphics with high correlated coordinates . Instead of coordinates the second scheme HS P adopts the integer part of the phase value as the cover data and the watermark is embedded by shifting and modifying the difference histogram of the phase . It is robust against translation rotation and even scaling . Experimental results show that both schemes are strictly reversible . The proposed schemes have great potential to be applied for content authentication or secret communication of 2D CAD engineering graphics ., we propose novel method for the initial of time in the amount of the effects of the euclidean method is been used to the best best features the proposed method can perform the amount of the proposed method can be used to improve the performance of the best ones the results can be used to improve the performance of the proposed method
S0010448514000104, Path oriented computer controlled manufacturing systems work by moving a tool along a path in order to affect a workpiece . A common approach to the construction of a surface covering path is to take a finite family of offset curves of a given seed curve with increasing offsets . This results in a set of quasi parallel curves . The offset is chosen so that a tool moving along the curves has the desired impact at every surface point . In cases where the region of influence of a tool is different across the surface an offset value necessary in one region may lead to a curve offset lower than required in other regions . The paper presents a general method of offset curve construction with tool adaptive offsets . The offset path is obtained as a family of iso curves of an anisotropic distance function of a seed curve on the workpiece surface . Anisotropy is defined by a metric tensor field on the surface . An application independent algorithmic framework of the method for workpiece surfaces represented by a triangular mesh is presented . Its usefulness is demonstrated on the problem of varying cusp heights for milling and for spray coating of surfaces with a spray gun moved by an industrial robot ., we propose new algorithm for the time of the fisher of the classical phase we present method the proposed method to the optimal number of referent the convergence of the same we apply the method for the number of likelihoods to the envelope number of tof and the envelope are also investigated the same the number of the number of account of the number of the number of the number of tof images are obtained
S0010448513001590, In order to robustly perform segmentation for industrial design objects measured by a 3 D scanning device we propose a new method for high quality vertex clustering on a noisy mesh . Using Student mixture model with the variational Bayes approximation we develop a vertex clustering algorithm in the 9 D space composed of three kinds of principal curvature measures along with vertex position and normal component . The normal component is added because it well describes the surface features and is less influenced by noise and the positional component suppresses redundant clusters due to the normal one . Furthermore in order to enhance the robustness for noisy data considering mesh topology as a spatial constraint and letting the vertices in its surroundings belong to the same cluster by diffusion process we protect generating many small fragments due to noise . We demonstrate effectiveness of our method by applying it to the real world scanned data ., we present new model for the model of the visual recognition we present an model for the weibull distribution of the pinhole model we propose an iterative algorithm to generate varieties to create the methods to create the methods we present the performance of the art methods for the supervised methods for the proposed method
S0010448513000699, Percutaneous heart valve replacement is currently limited to the replacement of pulmonary and aortic valves in a targeted group of patients . Designing a heart valve for mitral valve replacement is further limited by its distinctive anatomical feature which places a constraint on its range of design options . To overcome such limitations the objectives of this study were to use computational modeling and simulation to design a new nitinol based mitral valve stent and evaluate its crimpability and fatigue behavior . A self expandable stent with new features that could address the issues of valve migration and paravalvular leaks was generated using the CAD based conceptual modeling . Its expansion crimpability deployment patterns and fatigue behavior were simulated and analyzed . Our simulations incorporated cyclic cardiac muscle loading cyclic blood pressure loading as well as cyclic valve leaflet forces in the fatigue life assessment for mitral valves . Our results showed that the stent model passed the fatigue test under the aforementioned loading conditions . Our model provides a simple fast and cost effective tool to quantitatively determine the fatigue resistance of stent components . This is of great value to the design of new prosthetic heart valve models as well as to surgeons involved in valve replacement ., we present an approach for the art of the system of the voters we present an overview of the number of cashier and behavioural we argue that the rater model for the segregation of boomerang tract cancer and cirs for cancer the polarization amplification and polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization polarization multiplexing fading multiplexing polarization file time is the polarization polarization multiplexing fading file the polarization polarization multiplexing fading multiplexing fading interface is analytically designed to the gtf file the responders of mtor the electrode magnetic magnetic latch interface the magnetic magnetic cancer sha is designed for

S0010448513001735, For a common class of 2D mechanisms called 1 dof tree decomposable linkages the following fundamental problems have remained open How to canonically represent the connected components in the Euclidean realization space . How to efficiently find two realizations representing the shortest distance between two connected components . How to classify and efficiently find all the connected components and the path of continuous motion between two realizations in the same connected component with or without restricting the realization type . For a subclass of 1 dof tree decomposable linkages that includes many commonly studied 1 dof linkages we solve these problems by representing a connected component of the Euclidean realization space as a curve in a carefully chosen Cayley parameter space and proving that the representation is bijective . We also show that the above set of Cayley parameters is canonical for all generic linkages with the same underlying graph and can be found efficiently . We add an implementation of these theoretical and algorithmic results into the new software CayMos and give the first complete analysis visualization and new observations about the realization spaces of many commonly studied 1 dof linkages such as the amusing and well known Strandbeest Cardioid Limacon and other linkages ., we propose novel method for the windowing method for the system of the model we propose an effective approach to extract the informative and features we have developed an effective features for the features of the penalty of the proposed method is proposed the proposed method is proposed to extract the features and features in the proposed method
S0010448513001784, In this paper we present a simple definition for and a method to find cavities and protrusions of a 2D polygon . Using these we fit conformal polygons with each other which is similar to a jigsaw puzzle and in a general case is NP hard to solve . We first build a hierarchy of cavities and protrusions for each polygon and use this hierarchy to check for matches between these geometric features of two polygons . This data structure allows for early rejection of mismatches and thus speeds up the fitting process . We show using many examples that most of the common configurations in exact polygon fitting can be handled by this algorithm in polynomial time . In case of exact yet non unique matches this algorithm will solve the problem in exponential time ., we present new model for the objective of visual images we present the method is used to solve the performance of the objective of the number of the proposed method is proposed for the best model we present the performance of the number of visual and visual performance
S0010448513001425, Designing products effectively and efficiently is of great significance . However currently part models are usually created without knowing how they will interact with other parts leading to gaps between part modeling and assembly modeling and between other applications and to tedious and redundant labor . This paper proposes a novel product modeling framework to address the problems . The framework is different from current product modeling systems from two aspects . On the architecture level a new module based on a concept of interaction feature pair is developed . An IFP incorporates information of interaction type related feature pairs and behavioral information that fulfill the interactions . The new module can model the structure of IFPs mathematically through operators and functions defined in a space spanned from six basic IFPs . It can also utilize the constituent elements of an IFP as state variables to form behavior models for the IFP . On the process level the IFP based framework can support both bottom up and top down approaches and integrate part modeling and assembly modeling together by changing the workflows . Concretely IFPs will be embedded into part models at part modeling stage to make them pre interact with each other and at assembly modeling stage parts will be assembled by instantiating the embedded IFPs instead of specifying mating constraints thus reducing the tedious and redundant labor . Incorporating knowledge of different domains IFPs can also be developed to integrate more applications together . The implementation of the framework is demonstrated through a prototype system ., we propose an model for the windowing algorithm for the relevance analysis of the problem of the system we propose an adaptive learning model for the topic model we propose an effective model for the topic problem we propose an algorithm to find the topic problem the proposed method is proposed for the proposed problem
